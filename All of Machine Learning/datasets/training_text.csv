9093,2015-02-24 06:35:26 -0800,nan,@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
9094,2015-02-24 06:31:57 -0800,nan,@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
9095,2015-02-24 06:30:04 -0800,nan,@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek

9102,2015-02-24 06:07:21 -0800,nan,@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
9103,2015-02-24 06:04:32 -0800,nan,@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè

9243,2015-02-23 17:21:38 -0800,nan,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening

9248,2015-02-23 16:55:28 -0800,nan,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.

9258,2015-02-23 16:37:23 -0800,nan,@USAirways I‚Äôd suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.

9262,2015-02-23 16:34:15 -0800,nan,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
9263,2015-02-23 16:29:13 -0800,nan,@USAirways very embarrassing.
9264,2015-02-23 16:28:47 -0800,nan,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
9265,2015-02-23 16:22:10 -0800,nan,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
9266,2015-02-23 16:21:51 -0800,nan,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs

10929,2015-02-20 06:28:02 -0800,nan,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate

10936,2015-02-20 06:13:20 -0800,nan,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
10937,2015-02-20 06:12:45 -0800,nan,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
10938,2015-02-20 06:12:16 -0800,nan,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.

12904,2015-02-23 14:17:11 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?

13647,2015-02-23 00:22:27 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
13648,2015-02-23 00:13:52 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
13649,2015-02-23 00:11:44 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.

14134,2015-02-22 16:59:52 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
14135,2015-02-22 16:58:11 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
14136,2015-02-22 16:57:59 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
14137,2015-02-22 16:57:11 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
14138,2015-02-22 16:56:54 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
14139,2015-02-22 16:56:46 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
14140,2015-02-22 16:56:04 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
14141,2015-02-22 16:55:55 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
14142,2015-02-22 16:55:44 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
14143,2015-02-22 16:55:22 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
14144,2015-02-22 16:54:58 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
14145,2015-02-22 16:54:55 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
14146,2015-02-22 16:54:43 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
14147,2015-02-22 16:54:22 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
14148,2015-02-22 16:54:11 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!

14150,2015-02-22 16:53:16 -0800,nan,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
